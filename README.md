# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
Now that I have your attention let me introduce myself,
Mi name is Ticiano Mensegue, from Argentina,
I love to create is the best way to define me, I always persuit knowledge, always learning new things, I love cooking as much as I love technologies, always being informed about what's new, what's coming and what's becoming obsolete. Recently I got the opportunity to unite all of that when i decided to learn programing and found my place in this world. Now i can say that I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer, better at Back-End but open to improve my Front-End as well. Every day is a new chance to learn and grow and I love that about Programing, also I'm great working with others, and recently found out that I also like teaching others.
